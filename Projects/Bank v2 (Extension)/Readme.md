# Bank Management System (C++)

This is a simple console-based Bank Management System written in C++ (C++14). The application allows you to manage clients, perform transactions, and view account information using a text file as the data store.

## Features

- Show all clients
- Add new client
- Delete client
- Update client information
- Find client by account number
- Deposit and withdraw money
- View total balances

## How It Works

- All client data is stored in `ClientFile.txt`.
- The application uses a menu-driven interface for navigation.
- Each client has an account number, PIN code, name, phone, and balance.

## Usage

1. **Compile the code** using a C++14 compatible compiler:
2. **Run the program**:
3. **Follow the on-screen menu** to manage clients and perform transactions.

## File Structure

- `Bank v2 (Extension).cpp` - Main source code file.
- `ClientFile.txt` - Data file for storing client information.

## Notes

- Make sure `ClientFile.txt` is in the same directory as the executable.
- The program uses simple text-based storage; no database is required.
- All operations are performed via the console.
