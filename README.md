# 🚀 My Programming Journey: From Zero to Backend

Welcome to my personal journey as a self-taught developer.  
This repository documents every step I take from solving algorithms in C++ to building full backend applications in C# and SQL.

## 🔥 Why I'm Doing This

I believe that:
> "Code is the language of logic, and every line I write brings me closer to clarity."

This repo is both my **learning archive** and my **public proof of progress**.
