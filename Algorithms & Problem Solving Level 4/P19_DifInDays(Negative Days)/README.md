# Date Difference Calculator (C++14)

This program reads two dates from the user and calculates the difference between them in days. If the second date is earlier than the first, the result is shown as a negative value (which can be interpreted as minutes if needed). The program also supports including the end day in the calculation.

## Features

- Input validation for year, month, and day.
- Leap year support.
- Calculates the difference in days (optionally including the end day).
- Handles negative differences if the second date is before the first.

## Example
