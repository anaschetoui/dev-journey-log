# String to Date and Date to String Converter (C++)

## Overview

This program reads a date string in the format `dd/mm/yyyy`, converts it to a date structure, prints the day, month, and year separately, and then converts the date structure back to a string for display.

## Features

- Reads a date string from user input.
- Splits the string into day, month, and year.
- Stores the date in a `stDate` structure.
- Prints each component (day, month, year) separately.
- Converts the structure back to a string and displays it.

## Example
 - ``input``
```
Enter Date dd/mm/yyyy: 2/8/2025
```
- ``output``
```
Day: 2
Month: 8
Year: 2025

You entered : 2/8/2025
