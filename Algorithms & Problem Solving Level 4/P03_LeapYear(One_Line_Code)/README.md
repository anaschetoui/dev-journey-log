# Leap Year Checker (Optimized C++ Version)

## Problem Statement
Write a program to check if a year is a leap year or not.

### Leap Year Rules
- All years perfectly divisible by 4 are leap years **except** for century years (years ending with 00).
- Century years are leap years **only** if they are perfectly divisible by 400.

## Features
- Input validation for year (must be between 1 and 2099).
- Optimized logic for leap year checking.
- Clear user prompts and error handling.

## Usage
1. Compile the code using a C++14 compatible compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter a year when prompted.
4. The program will display whether the entered year is a leap year.

## Example

**Input:**  
2000

**Output:**  
Yes, Year [2000] is a leap year.

---

**Input:**  
1900

**Output:**  
No, Year [1900] isn't a leap year.

---

**Input:**  
2024

**Output:**  
Yes, Year [2024] is a leap year.
