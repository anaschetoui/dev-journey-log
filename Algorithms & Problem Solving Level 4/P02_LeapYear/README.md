# Leap Year Checker

This C++ program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not, following the standard leap year rules:

- All years divisible by 4 are leap years, except for century years (ending with 00).
- Century years are leap years only if they are divisible by 400.

## Features

- Input validation for year (must be between 1 and 2099).
- Clear user prompts and error messages.
- Leap year determination logic as per the rules above.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++14 compatible compiler:
2. Run the executable:
3. Enter a year when prompted. The program will display whether it is a leap year.

## Example
Input: 2000  
Output: Yes,Year [2000] is a leap year.

Input: 1900  
Output: No,Year [1900] is not a leap year.

Input: 2023
